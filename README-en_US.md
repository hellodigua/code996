# code996

code996 is an analytics tool that can be used to calculate the commit time distribution of a Git project and derive the coding intensity of that project.

English | [简体中文](./README.md)

## How to Use

For Mac or Linux users.

**In the root directory of your Git project**, run the following command.

```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://fastly.jsdelivr.net/gh/hellodigua/code996/bin/code996_en.sh)"
```

Windows users.

Download the script `https://fastly.jsdelivr.net/gh/hellodigua/code996/bin/code996_en.sh`

Then move the script to the Git project directory you want to analyze, and execute the following command.

```sh
sh code996_en.sh
```

## How it works

1. use git-log to query the project **current branches** and get the commit statistics summarized by hour and by day
2. convert the query results from the local script to URL arguments and open the URL to the browser
3. get the data from the URL, process it with some rules, and visualize the results

## Is it safe?

1. neither the script side nor the web side collects any data
2. the URL itself does not disclose sensitive information such as project name, except for common data such as start time of analysis, commit statistics, etc.
3. all code has been open source, accepting community supervision

## Caution

- The analysis results are for reference only and do not constitute any recommendation
- The original analysis data is transmitted via URL, please be careful if you want to share it
- Please do not use it for official purposes

## Other Questions

### Q: What is the 996 Index?

The 996 Index is a data indicator defined by the project to reflect the overtime situation of the project.

After standardizing the overtime situation, we can easily compare the work intensity of projects across teams and companies.

### Q: Under what circumstances are code996's analysis results inaccurate?

- The default statistics of the script is the overall project commit time, which represents the work status of all participants in the project during this time, and may deviate from the actual situation of individuals
- In addition to coding, we also need to meet, write documents, study and fish, so it can't cover the actual working time either
- Projects developed across borders and time zones cannot be counted correctly
- Projects with irregular working hours (e.g. personal open source projects) can't be counted either

### Q: I have a better idea

Any ideas and comments are welcome to share, and you are welcome to modify it after Fork.
